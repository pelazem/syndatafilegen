Welcome! This git repo contains a file generation utility used to generate synthetic data for a variety of scenarios, especially where it is impractical to clone, mask, scrub, or otherwise reuse "production" data due to concerns about security, compliance, PHI/PII, etc. while still needing test data that looks like production data.
